<h2> Situation </h2>

Amina is a young motivated moroccan who is intrested in self improvement industry. Along hitting the gym and eating healthy, she wishes to start reading more self help books. Since the books are mainly writeen in a foreign language, she thinks if only they were written in her native language so they would speak to her more and they would help her with her inconsistency.

"Nowadays, informing about the world is a must" says Omar to his friend at the coffee shop. He also claims it is hard to keep up with the international news especially when hard concepts such as inflation or price cap on Russia are exposed. Omar thinks it would be intresting if the news articles were written in moroccan Darija to help understand what is going on in the world.
